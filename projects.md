<h3>2-Group Belyi Maps</h3>
  For my Ph.D. thesis I am studying
  Galois Belyi maps with monodromy group a 2-group.
  If you don't know what a Belyi map is
  (and you are curious) take a look at my
  [poster on dessins d'enfants](/assets/belyi_poster.pdf).

<h3>Computing Canonical Rings of Hilbert Modular Forms</h3>
  I worked on a large (10 person) team to implement techniques
  to compute canonical rings of Hilbert modular forms.
  I was responsible for the data structure to store
  and compute with Fourier expansions of
  Hilbert modular forms necessary to support these computations.

<h3>A Database of Belyi Maps</h3>
  In this paper, we compute a database of thousands of Belyi
  maps up to degree 9.
  On top of the group effort to compute an exhaustive list of Belyi
  maps, my main responsibility in this project was implementing the database
  backend using [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/)
  (see repository below) to save the results.
  I then worked in a team of 4 to migrate the data over to the
  <i>L-functions and Modular Froms Database</i>
  [LMFDB](http://www.lmfdb.org)
  
  This paper was awarded the Selfridge Prize in Number Theory at
  [ANTS-XIII](http://www.math.grinnell.edu/~paulhusj/ants2018/index.html)

<h3>Understanding the cost of dermatologic care: A survey study of dermatology providers, residents, and patients</h3>
  Using [R](https://www.r-project.org/),
  I ran the statistical analysis for survey results in this dermatology
  study and generated Likert scale visualizations to analyze the data.

<h3>Numerical calculation of three-point branched covers of the projective line</h3>
  In this paper, we implement a general numerical method to compute
  Belyi maps using power series expansions of modular forms.
  I implemented code to visualize Belyi maps as (equivalent) dessins dâ€™enfants
  conformally embedded in the hyperbolic unit disk.
  My code produced figures (such as the one at the top of this page) drawn using
  [PSTricks](http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi/).
